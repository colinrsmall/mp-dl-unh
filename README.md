# mp-dl-unh
This project is a part of the [MMS mission](https://lasp.colorado.edu/mms/sdc/public/) at the University of Colorado-Boulder's [Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics](http://lasp.colorado.edu/home/) and the University of New Hampshire's [Space Science Center](https://eos.unh.edu/space-science-center). 

#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Project Intro/Objective
The mp-dl-unh software will be designed to provide automated magnetopause crossing selection suggestions for the SITL selection team. The software uses a [TensorFlow Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras) [LSTM (long short term memory) neurel network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory) trained on previous magnetopause selections in order to generate suggested crossing selection windows.
